CONCEPT

Battle tanks allows players to take control of a tank. 
The object of the game is to defeat the AI controlled enemy tank before
they defeat you. The game is played in a large, open space with angular 
hills and other terrain providing cover. Mortars are placed as an 
environmental hazard to the player, as to increase the challenge 
and maintain a sense of pressure. The game is won when the player defeats the enemy tank, and lost
when the player's health reaches 0
